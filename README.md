# Voice Recorder in Python

The Voice Recorder in Python is a simple script that leverages the `sounddevice` library to record audio for a specified duration and saves it as a WAV file using the `scipy.io.wavfile` module.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Before running the script, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install sounddevice scipy
